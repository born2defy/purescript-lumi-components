# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, particularly for bug fixes or suggestions, but we want to be clear upfront that this library tool specific to Lumi's needs. We may not take contributions we don't have a use for, especially if they add third party dependencies or cause breaking API changes we'll need to account for. Please ask/propose in an issue if you're unsure.
